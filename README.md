# Analyzing-Shopper-Behavior-and-Market-Basket-Patterns-with-Apache-Spark

## Project Overview
This project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on over 3 million grocery orders from Instacart to uncover shopper behavior patterns. Using Apache Spark on Databricks, I implemented the FP-Growth algorithm for market basket analysis to identify product associations and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset
The analysis utilized Instacart's anonymized dataset released on Kaggle in 2017.

Key Features: Over 3 million orders from 200,000+ users, each containing 4 to 100 orders with detailed product sequences.
Purpose: Explore customer purchasing patterns and optimize product recommendations.
Dataset Source: Instacart Dataset on Kaggle
