# Market Basket Analysis with Apache Spark

## Project Overview
This project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on over 3 million grocery orders from Instacart to uncover shopper behavior patterns. Using Apache Spark on Databricks, I implemented the FP-Growth algorithm for market basket analysis to identify product associations and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset
The analysis utilized Instacart's anonymized dataset, which was released on Kaggle in 2017.

**Key Features**: Over 3 million orders from 200,000+ users, each containing 4 to 100 orders with detailed product sequences.<br/>
**Purpose**: Explore customer purchasing patterns and optimize product recommendations.<br/>
**Dataset Source**: [Instacart Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data) <br/>

##Platform & Tools
**Framework**: Apache Spark
**Languages**: PySpark, Spark SQL, and Scala
**Platform**: Databricks Cloud
